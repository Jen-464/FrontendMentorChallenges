# Summary

Hey there :wave: 

My name is Jennifer and I have intermediate knowledge of HTML/CSS/JS. I recently completed a 21 YouTube video called [Frontend Web Development Bootcamp Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJSY8tbf_ys) on May 2023. In this repository, I will be completing challenges from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges). The more I've been learning, the more intrigued I have become with front-end development. 

My new skillset as of May 2023 includes:

- Understanding of semantic HTML elements for structuring & accessibility 
- Understanding of CSS Flexbox & Grid
- Familiarity with vanilla JavaScript
- Knowledge in basic design principles
- Able to debug common front-end issues
- Proficiency in using Git & Github for collaboration

I currently work at a non-profit organization teaching the basics of front-end developing to a cohort of youth for a year. I help them understand how to navigate Figma as well to extract media and generally understand how to read it. This has helped me get deeper understanding, but I am looking to expand my knoweldge and take on more challenging projects. My goal is to become an experienced Front-End Developer to pursue a career in this field :white_heart: :raised_hands:
