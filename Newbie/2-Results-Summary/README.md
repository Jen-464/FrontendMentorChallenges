## Overview

### The challenge

[Results summary component](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/results-summary-component-CE_K6s0maV) is a challenge to not only practice Responsive Design, but dive into using a JSON file to display results dynamically

Your users should be able to:

- [X] View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- [X] See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My Process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML elements
- CSS Flex 
- CSS pseudo classes
- Mobile-first workflow
- Fetch API & DOM

### What I learned

Most of my learning came from researching how to display JSON information from a json file to the HTML file. I looked into JavaScript Promise, but ultimately went with the Fetch API as it made more sense. From there understanding how I wanted to lay out my HTML tags through JavaScript was tough and there had to be readjustments. These were necessary as it affected how I could use CSS with it.


### Useful resources

- [Learn JSON in 10 Minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiADhChRriM) - This youtube channel has been the best place to understand concepts for Web Development

- [JavaScript Promises in 10 Minuts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHvZLI7Db8E) - Here I learned how Promises work from scratch and how that relates to the format Fetch API is written in.

- [Learn Fetch API in 6 Minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cuEtnrL9-H0&t=221s) - Ultimately here is where I would properly learn about this topic and debug my code throughout to display the information necessary in HTML. 

- [Align SVG Icons to Text](https://blog.prototypr.io/align-svg-icons-to-text-and-say-goodbye-to-font-icons-d44b3d7b26b4) - I was having issues with aligning the icons to the text and the Medium website seems to have a lot of sources mainly relating to tech.
